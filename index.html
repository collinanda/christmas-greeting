        <h4>Merry Christmas Ol' Pal!</h4><br/><br/>
        
        Despite being at a distance and presumably enduring the many inconveniences around Covid… I hope this season will still be profitable for you in opportunities for joy and peace!<br/><br/>
        
        
        Recently I was watching a Christmas movie with Kixston (my son). It was about a toy maker that lost his passion after a pretty awful loss and had to get it back by “believing”. It was actually quite entertaining but of course I just had to thoroughly analyze the movie for its deeper meaning! The signing and dancing just wasn't enough.<br/><br/>
        
        I wish you could have “scene” it (I know how much you love puns) because in this one scene the Protagonist was being instructed to believe. Unsurprisingly, like most Christmas movies, the guy made a face that was unrecognizably different from having a seriously painful bowel movement lol… You can imagine how hard I laughed. This apparently was supposed to resemble the “natural” face of “belief conjuring” and the moment where everything changed for him. Oddly enough though, this actually reminded me of when I was a kid. I can remember my Mom instructing me to “accept Jesus into my heart” and “believe the truth” and like a child, I furrowed my brow, squeezed my eyes shut and imagined I was cranking some gears in my heart (unrecognizably different from those bowel movements I was mentioning XD). Disappointingly, I opened them with no sign of Jesus or God in my bedroom, as if that’s what my Mom promised (she didn’t).<br/><br/>
        
        After the movie, I was unexpectedly pressed with a question from my son: “How do you believe?”. It was pretty clear then that he was wanting a “believing for dummies” briefing as the movie failed to explain it’s not done by a silly face you make. As I considered the naivety of his question, I realized it’s actually something most adults believe, I myself can occasionally fall victim to thinking I have to do emotional gymnastics to believe. How interesting: with our beliefs being as incredibly important as they are; the very things that dictate our thoughts, actions and desires, the common understanding is to create them by disfiguring our faces and cranking our heart gears. Gotta love humans.<br/><br/>
        
        Being genuinely puzzled by the question I remembered, here’s where most roll the eyes, a passage from the bible:<br/><br/>
            
            <div class="indent">
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">Romans 10:17</span><br/><br/>
                So then faith
