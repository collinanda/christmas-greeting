        <h4>Merry Christmas Ol' Pal!</h4><br/><br/>

        Despite being at a distance and presumably enduring the many inconveniences around Covid… I hope this season will still be profitable for you in opportunities for joy and peace!<br/><br/>

        Recently I was watching a Christmas movie with Kixston (my son). It was about a toy maker that lost his passion after a pretty awful loss and had to get it back by “believing”. It was actually quite entertaining but of course I just <i>had</i> to thoroughly analyze the movie for its deeper meaning! The singing and dancing just wasn’t enough.<br/><br/>

        I wish you could have “scene” it (I know how much you love puns) because in this one scene the Protagonist was being instructed to believe and what he did was pretty ridiculous. Unsurprisingly, like most Christmas movies, the guy made a face that was unrecognizably different from having a seriously painful bowel movement lol… You can imagine how hard I laughed. This apparently was supposed to resemble the “natural” face of “belief conjuring” and the moment where everything changed for him. Oddly enough though, this actually reminded me of when I was a kid. I can remember my Mom instructing me to “accept Jesus into my heart” and “believe the truth” and like a child, I furrowed my brow, squeezed my eyes shut and imagined I was cranking some gears in my heart (unrecognizably different from those bowel movements I was mentioning XD). Disappointingly, I opened them with no sign of Jesus or God in my bedroom, as if that’s what my Mom promised (she didn’t).<br/><br/>

        After the movie, I was unexpectedly pressed with a question from my son: “How do you believe?”. It was pretty clear then that he was wanting a “believing for dummies” briefing as the movie failed to explain it’s not done by a silly face you make. As I considered the naivety of his question, I realized it’s actually something most adults believe, I myself can occasionally fall victim to thinking I have to do emotional gymnastics to believe. How interesting: with our beliefs being as incredibly important as they are; the very things that dictate our thoughts, actions and desires, the common understanding is to create them by disfiguring our faces and cranking our “heart gears” just enough to “make something happen” or “want them bad enough”. Gotta love humans.<br/><br/>

        As I struggled to explain it to my 8 year old son, I could see him slowly connecting the concept with reality. Beliefs really are the things that we allow to dictate our thoughts, actions and desires and undoubtedly, if they’re not rooted in reality/truth… things get messy. <br/><br/>

        I’m not sure what it is that’s encouraging you to read this in the New Year, maybe you’re wanting to see if the things you’ve heard are true. I wanted to send you something meaningful especially since you mentioned it’s your New Year’s Resolution to read it more. So with the gift I sent you, it matters that you read it. Not for me, but for you. But also because I spent a lot of time coding this site lol!<br/><br/>

        There will be things that don’t immediately make sense and that’s where most people criticize and complain... that’s where they give up and call it crazy and choose not to believe in the things that are unwaveringly true. As small as it may seem, that choice has significant affects. How is that any different from the drop outs while you were in university? If they would have persevered, they would have come to understanding and what an awesome thing that would have been. So it is with this.<br/><br/>

        God promises that his word is true and that it makes sense (“… and Scripture cannot be broken” John 10:35, “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness…” 2 Timothy 3:16-17). If he claims it can’t be broken, only disprove it and there would be no reason for the Christian faith. That’s what I tried to do, I failed. If this guy apparently died for us, loves us infinitely whether we screw up or not, gives us breath every day and the method we count our oh-so-precious time was founded on the time of his birth (Jesus was born 2020 years ago, it’s currently the year 2020)… why wouldn’t we give the benefit of the doubt and hear what he has to say? <br/><br/>

        You just have to seek it brother. I hope you do desperately.<br/><br/>

        Oh and stay away from people that say God will make you rich and healthy lol God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied <span style="text-decoration:underline">in him</span>, not in materials or things of this world… truth be told, we’re not the centre of the universe lol! If you want help, reach out. I’d love to help. If you don’t want to reach out, go to websites/people that actually study the bible and weigh their opinion against your own, don’t be passive. Here’s a good site to start:<br/><br/>

        You and I are both sinners, both guilty.. we could both testify against each other really. We both know this isn’t how we ought to be but is it clear yet we can’t change that by our own power? Thank God he gave the solution through Jesus, cause he didn’t really have to. Only believe reality, believe who Jesus really is and that sin problem <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will begin</span> to fade. The trouble is fighting to desire the truth more than our selfishness in not caring for someone to tell us how to live our lives. Well, if we’re so good at it, why do we have sin? I’ll be praying for you man. Love you big guy!<br/><br/>

        Your crazy Christian friend,<br/>
